pros
flexability on when to create new commits

cons
commits may be to large or to small

Why do you think some version control systems, like git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like google docs, treat each file seperately?

Git understands that files can be related to each other when used for code.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log provides a list of changes, their id and description

git diff compares two commits and highlights the changes between commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

You can easily revert to a previous version of the code, using the git checkout <changed id> command.
